                  The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest species among the
                  Felidae and classified in the genus Panthera. It is most
                  recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orangish-brown
                  fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator,
                  primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It
                  is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator,
                  requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its
                  requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs
                  stay with their mother for about two years, before they become
                  independent and leave their mother's home range to establish
                  their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region
                  in the west to the Amur River basin, and in the south from the
                  foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands. Since
                  the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least
                  93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in
                  Western and Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali,
                  and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China.
                  Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian
                  temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the
                  Indian subcontinent and Sumatra. The tiger is listed as
                  Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986. As of 2015, the
                  global wild tiger population was estimated to number between
                  3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, down from around 100,000
                  at the start of the 20th century, with most remaining
                  populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each
                  other. Major reasons for population decline include habitat
                  destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. This, coupled
                  with the fact that it lives in some of the more densely
                  populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts
                  with humans.
