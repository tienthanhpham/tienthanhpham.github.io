                  The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it
                  is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a
                  reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of
                  its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; male lions have a
                  prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the
                  species. With a typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm
                  (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72
                  in). It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A
                  lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and
                  cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying
                  mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone
                  predator, although some lions scavenge when opportunities
                  occur, and have been known to hunt humans, although the
                  species typically does not.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas but is
                  absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other
                  big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at
                  night and at twilight. In the Pleistocene, the lion ranged
                  throughout Eurasia, Africa and North America but today it has
                  been reduced to fragmented populations in Sub-Saharan Africa
                  and one critically endangered population in western India. It
                  has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996
                  because populations in African countries have declined by
                  about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are
                  untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the
                  cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and
                  conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
