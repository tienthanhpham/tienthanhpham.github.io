                  The cougar (Puma concolor) is a large felid of the subfamily
                  Felinae. It is native to the Americas.[1] Its range spans from
                  the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes in South America, and
                  is the widest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the
                  Western Hemisphere. It is an adaptable, generalist species,
                  occurring in most American habitat types.[3] Due to its wide
                  range, it has many names including mountain lion, puma, red
                  tiger, and catamount.[4]
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is the second-heaviest cat in the New World after the
                  jaguar. Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar
                  is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular,
                  although daytime sightings do occur.[5][6][7][8] The cougar is
                  more closely related to smaller felines, including the
                  domestic cat, than to any species of subfamily
                  Pantherinae,[2][9] of which only the jaguar is extant in the
                  Americas.

                  The cougar is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety
                  of prey. Primary food sources are ungulates, particularly
                  deer. It also hunts species as small as insects and rodents.
                  This cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky
                  areas for stalking, but can also live in open areas. The
                  cougar is territorial and survives at low population
                  densities. Individual territory sizes depend on terrain,
                  vegetation, and abundance of prey. While large, it is not
                  always the apex predator in its range, yielding prey it has
                  killed to lone jaguars, American black bears, and grizzly
                  bears, American alligators (Florida Panther predation mainly),
                  and to groups of gray wolves. It is reclusive and mostly
                  avoids people. Fatal attacks on humans are rare, but have
                  recently been increasing in North America as more people enter
                  cougar territories, and build developments such as farms in
                  their established territory.[10]
