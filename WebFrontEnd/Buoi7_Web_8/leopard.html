                  The leopard or panther (Panthera pardus) is one of the five
                  extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the
                  Felidae.[4] It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa,
                  in small parts of Western and Central Asia, on the Indian
                  subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia. It is listed as
                  Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations
                  are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are
                  declining in large parts of the global range. In Hong Kong,
                  Singapore, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in
                  Morocco, leopard populations have already been extirpated.[3]
                  Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only
                  25% of its historical global range.[5][6] Leopards are hunted
                  illegally, and their body parts are smuggled in the wildlife
                  trade for medicinal practices and decoration.[7][8]

                <p>
                  Compared to other wild cats, the leopard has relatively short
                  legs and a long body with a large skull. Its fur is marked
                  with rosettes. It is similar in appearance to the jaguar, but
                  has a smaller, lighter physique, and its rosettes are
                  generally smaller, more densely packed and without central
                  spots. Both leopards and jaguars that are melanistic are known
                  as black panthers. The leopard is distinguished by its
                  well-camouflaged fur, opportunistic hunting behaviour, broad
                  diet, strength, and its ability to adapt to a variety of
                  habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe, including arid and
                  montane areas. It can run at speeds of up to 58 kilometres per
                  hour (36 mph).[9] The earliest known leopard fossils excavated
                  in Europe are estimated 600,000 years old, dating to the late
                  Early Pleistocene.[2] Leopard fossils were also found in
                  Japan.[10]

                  The leopard's skin colour varies between individuals from pale
                  yellowish to dark golden with dark spots grouped in rosettes.
                  Its belly is whitish and its ringed tail shorter than its
                  body. Its pupils are round.[17] Leopards living in arid
                  regions are pale cream, yellowish to ochraceous and rufous in
                  colour; those living in forests and mountains are much darker
                  and deep golden. Spots fade toward the white underbelly and
                  the insides and lower parts of the legs.[18] Rosettes are
                  circular in East African leopard populations, and tend to be
                  squarish in Southern African and larger in Asian leopard
                  populations. The fur tends to be grayish in colder climates,
                  and dark golden in rain forest habitats.[9] The pattern of the
                  rosettes is unique in each individual.[1
